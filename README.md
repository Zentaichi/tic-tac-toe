# Tic-Tac-Toe React Tutorial

This application was made following the [react.dev](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) tutorial for building a small tic-tac-toe game.

## React + TypeScript + Vite

This uses a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules due to the deprecations of one of the dependencies offered in the tutorial.


## Setup
First, start by installing dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
Then run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```
